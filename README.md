Practicing with Apple Maps and MKMapView
* I've been wanting to play around with Apple Maps for a while and this gave me a chance to do so. I just inputted the coordinates
of what I wanted and selected it to add annotations. 
* After I did that, I wanted the user to be able to use a gesture (long button press) to be able to drop their own pins. It's crude, but the 
idea is solid, and can be expanded on later. 
I hope you enjoy, and if you have any experience with Google Maps, let me know what you did.
